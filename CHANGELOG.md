This is a list of new fixes and other changes made to SOUP during its continued development.

SOUP version numbering generally follows the _major.minor.patch_ scheme.  Odd minor versions (1.1.x, 1.3.x, 1.5.x, etc.) are reserved for unstable development versions ("devel" branch on [GitHub][github]), while even ones denote stable releases ("master" branch on [GitHub][github]).  The change log below thus only includes even version numbers, as changes between development versions are too numerous to list.


1.57 (development)
====

**New fixes in 1.57.x:**

* [mse331640: Syntax highlight and MathJax is not rendered after reloading an edited post](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/33164)
* [music396: jTab needs to render in Markdown preview](https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/q/396) (music.SE only)

**Other changes:**

* Added a new `SOUP.loadPrivileges()` helper method to fetch user privilege thresholds from the SE API (and cache them in LocalStorage).  This is currently used by the [mse115702](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/115702) fix to detect access to "trusted user" features (specifically, being able to vote to delete negatively scored answers).  This replaces the old `SOUP.isBeta` flag, which no longer exists.
* Worked around Greasemonkey 4 sometimes running `document-start` scripts before `document.documentElement` exists (https://github.com/greasemonkey/greasemonkey/issues/2996).
* Rewrote the [mse74274](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/74274) fix to work with the new share popup implementation.


1.56 (2019-08-06)
====

This release mostly fixes regressions introduced by changes to the SE user interface.  The main new feature is the ability to intercept text pasted into the Markdown editor, which is currently used for the [mse234680](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/234680) Unicode URL fix.

**New fixes in 1.56.0:**

* [mse322619: Can't see other pages of answers on a certain deleted question](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/322619)

**Removed fixes:**

* [math4130: The scope of \newcommand is the entire page](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/q/4130)
* [mse229363: Exclude TeX.SE question titles from MathJax parsing in Hot Network Questions](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/229363)

**Other changes:**

* The [mse234680](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/234680) fix now also fixes IRIs pasted into the edit box.
* Rewrote the [mse153528](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/153528) fix to work with the new "toast" style notification boxes.
* The [mse74274](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/74274) fix stopped working after changes to SE code, made it work again.
* Tweaked the [mse172931](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/172931) fix to correctly hide vote buttons on answers in review again.
* Tweaked the [mse291623](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/291623) CSS selector to only apply to the mobile view. (Avoids color mismatch for italic text in visited links on Chrome.)
* Added CSS to stop the [mso287222](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/287222) fix from pushing the new activity indicator on custom question filters to a separate line ([issue #44](https://github.com/vyznev/soup/issues/44)).


1.54 (2019-03-08)
====

It's been almost a year since the last SOUP release.  With the introduction of the new responsive SE design across the network and the adoption of the [Stacks](https://stackoverflow.design/) CSS library, a lot of old CSS bugs have finally been fixed (and, I'm sure, new ones have been introduced).  As I have not had much time to develop new fixes for SOUP over the past year, this release mostly involves trimming down the code and removing a number of old fixes that have become obsolete.

**New fixes in 1.54.0:**

* [mse308072: Clicking on tags in global search results is broken](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/308072)
* [mse307976: Can't see all the options while reviewing with a small screen](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/307976)

**Removed fixes:**

* [mse223737: Inbox heading should be a link](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/223737)
* [mse303599: The “Flag” modal keeps going down](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/303599)

* [mse114109: Background in OP's user name can obscure text in multiline comments](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/114109) (CSS)

* [mse110566: Does the spoiler markdown work on images?](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/110566) (CSS)
* [mse203405: Excerpt of privilege is below privilege instead of in front](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/203405) (CSS)
* [physics5773: Bounty icon is poorly placed](https://physics.meta.stackexchange.com/q/5773) (CSS)

* [math16559: Typo in site CSS disables visited link color in community bulletin](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/q/16559) (CSS)
* [electronics3162: Error for profile less info](https://electronics.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3162) (CSS)
* [electronics4038: About Me box on user page not in the right place](https://electronics.meta.stackexchange.com/q/4038) (CSS)
* [mso286009: Change \[Ask Question\] button style](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/286009) (CSS)
* [cooking2049: Ads are cut off on the right](https://cooking.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2049) (CSS)
* [movies1652: /users and profile pages (/users/…) space the link to the current profile (in the top bar) differently](https://movies.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1652) (CSS)

* [mso295666: Disable annoying autofocus when clicking preview](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/295666)
* [mse240787: Inconsistent reputation mouse-over text](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/240787)
* [mse170970: Occasionally, the Unicode character sequence U+200C U+200B (ZWNJ ZWSP) is inserted into comments](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/170970)
* [mse264171: SE new blog: Broken link on 'serverfault.com' and 'superuser.com' under 'TAGS'](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/264171)
* [mse293413: Let's see the Top Network Askers better](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/293413)

**Other changes:**

* Removed hardcoded maximum comment pixel width from [mse154788](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/154788) styles, as it no longer seems to be needed with the new responsive design.
* Temporarily disabled [math12902](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/q/12902) fix due to conflicts with new site CSS.
* Updated [mse234680](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/234680) fix to work with the new-style "add link" editor dialog.

**Removed fixes in 1.54.1:**

* [math27470: MathJax preview does not work when editing from review (or when editing a deleted question)](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/q/27470) (fixed by SE, SOUP fix now crashes editor when a backtick is typed!)


1.52 (2018-03-10)
====

**New fixes in 1.52.0:**

* [mse293413: Let's see the Top Network Askers better](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/293413)
* [mse178439: Can we exempt downvoted accepted answers from getting the top spot?](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/178439)
* [mse306254: Annoying animation on reputation leagues](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/306254) (CSS)
* [mso362554: Why are the chat FAQ in almost identical links different?](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/362554)
* [aviation3449: Accepted graphic missing in questions tab](https://aviation.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3449) (CSS, aviation.SE only)
* [physics10312: Why doesn't the LaTeX code under the tag “operators” shows what it's supposed to show?](https://physics.meta.stackexchange.com/q/10312)
* [math27470: MathJax preview does not work when editing from review (or when editing a deleted question)](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/q/27470)
* [mse293413: Sorting SEDE output is unstable](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/307605) (SEDE only)
* [mse307120: I cannot get bold or italics to work](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/307120) (on android, codereview, crypto, cs, graphicdesign, japanese, magento, music and salesforce; loads CSS from Google Fonts)

**Other changes:**

* Clean up some console noise on chat, SE.com and other non-QA sites that don't have the same `StackExchange` object as normal QA pages.
* Add missing `"use strict;"`.  SOUP code should already be strict mode compliant, but this ensures it.
* Use `CHAT.addEventHandlerHook()` instead of klugy WebSocket hack to apply content filters to new chat events.  Remove `SOUP.hookChat()` as obsolete.
* Remove vendor prefix fallbacks from [mse84296](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/84296) `unicode-bidi` CSS to avoid [weird breakage on Edge](https://github.com/vyznev/soup/issues/32).
* SOUP now installs a setter on `window.jQuery` to allow fixes that patch jQuery to run immediately after it has loaded.  (Unfortunately some browsers and user script managers have race conditions that make this unreliable; see e.g. [Tampermonkey issue #211](https://github.com/Tampermonkey/tampermonkey/issues/211).)
* Fix CSS bug in [mse217779](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/217779) fix causing pages with spoilers to have an unnecessary horizontal scroll bar.
* Update [mse213709](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/213709) fix to work with the new mobile comment HTML.
* Tweak [mse154788](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/154788) and [mse243519](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/243519) to (try to) avoid [a Chrome HTML rendering bug](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=813345) that can trigger spurious scroll bars on comments.
* The [mse266852](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/266852) fix now uses a pure CSS fallback to hide the separators before the script runs.

**Changes in 1.52.1:**

* Added an `@exclude` line to prevent SOUP from running on SO Teams pages due to [reports](https://github.com/vyznev/soup/issues/36) of breakage.  (Thanks, Monica Cellio!)  Unfortunately, SOUP is not currently supported on Teams due to the author's inability to test it in that environment.
* Also added regexp validation for partial HTML element IDs (e.g. editor postfixes) provided by SE code to callbacks before they're fed to jQuery.  This should hopefully prevent the same issue from coming up in other contexts.

**Changes in 1.52.2:**

* Disable the [mso345590](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/345590) fix on sites using the new [responsive design](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/310908), pending possible removal or reimplementation once the new design stabilizes and is deployed globally.  (The new design mostly solves the issue, except on *very* narrow displays, and the current fix implementation is not fully compatible with it.)

**Changes in 1.52.3:**

* Remove [mso345590](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/345590) entirely to avoid edge cases like [issue #41](https://github.com/vyznev/soup/issues/41).


1.50 (2018-01-23)
====

**New fixes in 1.50.0:**

* [mse213709: Allow flagging comments on mobile site](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/213709)
* [mso356880: “This post has been edited x time since you began” persists after saving the question](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/356880)
* [mse299082: Display embedded YouTube videos in markdown preview](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/299082) (on aviation, bicycles, gaming, movies, music, scifi, space and video)
* [mse291623: Links that are italics and bold not showing as links in Mobile Web](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/291623) (for mobile view)
* [mse287196: Tick sign is not centered on single badge page](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/287196)
* [mse303599: The “Flag” modal keeps going down](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/303599)
* [mse90713: Show “this question has an active bounty and cannot be closed” earlier, when it applies](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/90713)
* [mse302580: Printing an SE page in Firefox shows only the first page](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/302580)
* [mse302569: Alignment improvement in the flag dialog](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/302569)
* [mse304096: Comments and answers have huge right margins when printed](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/304096)
* [mso358862: 5 seconds is too long, but if it must be, then give me a visual cue](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/358862)
* [mse304247: Attempting to use too long tag breaks popup](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/304247)
* [boardgames1652: Switch Magic autocard over to a different search engine, Scryfall](https://boardgames.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1652) (replaces [boardgames1152](https://boardgames.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1152))
* [boardgames867: We should implement Magic the Gathering pop-ups on hover](https://boardgames.meta.stackexchange.com/q/867)
* [mso360855: Margins are off/unbalanced in inbox](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/360855)
* [mse286345: Mobile search made impossible with keyboard shortcuts enabled](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/286345)

**Removed fixes:**

* [mse143973: Images can be pushed outside the boundaries of a post by using nested lists](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/143973) (fixed)
* [mse210165: Extra blue line appearing in the top bar (Firefox only)](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/210165) (fixed by new top bar)

* [boardgames1152: Can the Magic card auto link feature be improved?](https://boardgames.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1152) (replaced by [boardgames1652](https://boardgames.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1652))

**Other changes:**

* [mse299086](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/299086) fix no longer breaks old links to metas of renamed sites (like http://meta.programmers.stackexchange.com).
* Add `@noframes` to userscript header to avoid needlessly loading the script for child frames.  (SOUP has already refused to actually injects its code into child frames since v1.40.)
* Rewrite [mse243519](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/243519) fix to work also in Chrome and to avoid layout jumps ([issue #30](https://github.com/vyznev/soup/issues/30)).
* Update [movies1652](https://movies.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1652), [mse210132](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/210132), [mse121682](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/121682) and [mse223737](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/223737) CSS / query selectors for new top bar structure.
* Remove klugy `SOUP.userRep` property in favor of `StackExchange.options.user.rep`.
* Rewrite [mso338932](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/338932) fix without using `touchstart` events to avoid [scroll performance issues](https://github.com/WICG/EventListenerOptions/blob/gh-pages/explainer.md#the-problem).
* Enabled the [movies1652](https://movies.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1652) fix also on workplace.SE, per https://workplace.meta.stackexchange.com/q/4917.
* [mse217779](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/217779): Make spoilers visible in print, stop the placeholder text from intercepting mouse clicks.
* [mso306552](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/306552) was broken by new inline SVG icons, reimplement in pure CSS (with a new custom icon design).

**Changes in 1.50.1:**

* Update [mse248646](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/248646) fix to work with new `.remainingCommentsCount()` method in SE comments UI.


1.48 (20 Sep 2017)
====

This release fixes a regression that broke the mhchem MathJax extension on sites that use it, and also contains several updates related to the recent switch to HTTPS and the upcoming top bar redesign.  Expect to possibly see a new stable release shortly, after the new top bar has been deployed to all SE sites.

**New fixes in 1.48.0:**

* [mso342634: “Hot Meta Posts” with a 4-digit score wrap onto a second line](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/342634) (CSS)

1.46 (11 Feb 2017)
====

It's been over a year since the last stable SOUP release, and this release consists mostly of the backlog of changes accumulated in the development branch during that time.

Unfortunately, I haven't had as much time to devote to maintaining SOUP lately as I had in the past.  When I started this project, I was hoping that others would join in to actively contribute patches to SOUP and maybe even become co-developers, so that I could eventually focus my efforts on coordination and quality control.  Alas, except for a couple of notable exceptions, this hasn't really happened, and so the development rate of SOUP remains limited by my personal free time and interest.  If you'd be interested in contributing to SOUP, or have any suggestions on how to make the project more accessible to new contributors, please let me know!

In particular, I haven't had time to do the extensive cross-browser pre-release testing of each fix that I used to do before each stable release.  I'm confident that none of the new fixes should have any major issues on either Chrome or Firefox, since I've been using them personally on both browsers for most of a year, but it's possible and even likely that some of the fixes in this release may have been made redundant in the mean time.  The best I can say is that at least this release is more up to date than v1.44. :)  Please report any problems or obsolete fixes that you may find, either on [GitHub](https://github.com/vyznev/soup/issues) or at [Stack Apps](https://stackapps.com/a/4488).

A major new feature in this release is that SOUP v1.46 will be the first stable SOUP release available as a browser extension on Chrome and Firefox.  A snapshot of the v1.45 development branch has been experimentally available as a browser extension for some time, but with this release, SOUP-as-an-extension is finally going official.  In particular, this means that you can now install SOUP on Firefox for Android!  Expect more mobile-specific fixes in future SOUP releases, and again, please report any and all problems you may observe.

**New fixes in 1.46.0:**

* [mse275976: Unable to see completed badges](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/275976) (credit: Patrick Hofman)
* [mse74274: Privacy leak in permalink?](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/74274) (incomplete)

**Removed fixes:**
* [mse229797: You are here, but where's here?](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/229797) (meta.SE only)
* [math11392: MathJax preview broken when equations contain `\\label`s](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/q/11392)
* [mse259692: Reputation for graph is off by a day](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/259692)
* [mso315436: The open source ads preview page is still using the old size; ads appear distorted as a result](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/315436)

**Other changes:**

* **SOUP can now be installed as a Firefox / Chrome extension.** (Thanks to Peanut for help and for prodding me into actually doing this!)
* Use a less hacky way to obtain the site and question IDs for realtime update subscription. (Thanks, enki-code!)
* Improved [mse259692](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/259692) fix by hacking the JS Date constructor and methods to pretend that local time is UTC.
* Tweaked [mse217779](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/217779) CSS to slightly slow down spoiler fade-in per [request](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/278935) and to add a notice text to spoilers per [another request](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/104085).
* Rewrote the [math19650](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/q/19650) fix to handle any display math syntax (including e.g. `\begin{equation}` ... `\end{equation}`) and to selectively disable display math in elements that should not contain it (currently comments, post summaries, question titles and the sidebar).
* Update [mse240417](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/240417) fix title.
* Content filters are now properly applied to the top bar menus (site switcher, inbox and achievements) loaded via Ajax.
* Re-enable [mse22372](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/22372) HTTPS link rewriting for per-site metas (disabled in v1.42 due to [issues with Cloudflare](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/265918)).
* [mse172931](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/172931) fix now uses DOMParser instead of an ugly jQuery hack to extract answers from the question page HTML.
* [mse234680](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/234680) fix handles optional link titles correctly (and fixes [a bug with non-BMP Unicode characters in URLs](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/285366) as a side effect).
* Rewrote [mse66646](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/66646) fix for compatibility with new SE code.  (The [related IME issue](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/216834) seems to have been fixed, but this can still be triggered e.g. by the Firefox spell checker menu.)
* Disabled the [mse207526](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/207526) fix when the [new topbar](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/343103) is enabled, to avoid issues with dialog positioning.  (Thanks, mjpieters!)

**Changes in 1.46.1:**

* Removed **[mse221304: Make all i.stack.imgur.com links protocol-relative](http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/221304)** (no longer needed)
* Prepare for the renaming of per-site meta hostnames from `meta.*.stackexchange.com` to `*.meta.stackexchange.com`, make sure fixes continue to run on the correct sites.
* Don't auto-rewrite links to the old meta hostnames to use HTTPS, since they have broken certs.


1.44 (5 Feb 2016)
====

Another somewhat delayed release.  A few fixes added, a few removed.  I'm trying out a new release strategy that should *hopefully* make the branch history easier to follow in the future.

**New fixes in 1.44.0:**

* [mse223737: Inbox heading should be a link](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/223737)
* [mso313853: “Per page” pagination returns no results when increasing limit on last page](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/313853)
* [mse259692: Reputation for graph is off by a day](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/259692) (partial fix)
* [mso315436: The open source ads preview page is still using the old size; ads appear distorted as a result](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/315436)

**Removed fixes:**

* [rpg3554: Skin does not handle read-only mode well](https://rpg.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3554)
* [cs537: Missing MathJaX in the duplicate subtab of the close review queue](https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/q/537) (original bug has been fixed; the SOUP fix was causing broken math rendering in various places, such as in the "vote to close as duplicate" dialog)
* [mse139175: When starring a message from the star board, it's not reflected in the main chat window](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/139175)
* [mso295276: Username filter does not abort old pending Ajax requests](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/295276)
* [mso308672: Alerts no longer work in StackOverflow snippets in Chrome 46+](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/308672)

**Other changes:**

* [mse234680](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/234680): Be less picky about what constitutes a valid hostname, rely on the browser to reject invalid ones.
* [mse153528](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/153528), [mso310158](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/310158): Avoid a ReferenceError if the StackExchange object is unavailable.
* [mse265889](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/265889): Move heading to just before the answer text (but after the vote buttons); tweak heading format to emphasize score more.  (Thanks to Samuli Kärkkäinen for feedback.)
* Make the [mse115702](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/115702) fix work in first posts / late answers review again (was broken since v1.38).
* [mse172931](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/172931): Fix broken MathJax rendering in Ajax-loaded answers.
* Add optional `path` regexp to fixes, to allow CSS fixes to be active only on certain pages; edit existing fixes with in-code path filtering to use it.
* Rewrite [mse66646](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/66646) to accommodate changes to SE code.

**Changes in v1.44.1:**

* Add `disabled` flag to temporarily turn off fixes.
* Temporarily disable [mso306325](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/306325) fix due to reported [issues](https://github.com/vyznev/soup/issues/24) on Firefox ESR.

**Changes in v1.44.2:**

* Remove [mse229797: You are here, but where's here?](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/229797), fixed by SE (and interfering with SOUP fix).

**Changes in v1.44.3:**

* The [mse234680](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/234680) fix broke on jQuery v1.12.4, fixed. (Reported by DavidPostill, thanks!)

**Changes in v1.44.4:**

* Update [mse66646](http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/66646) fix for jQuery v1.12.4 compatibility.


1.42 (2 Dec 2015)
====

**New fixes in 1.42.0:**

* [mse264171: SE new blog: Broken link on 'serverfault.com' and 'superuser.com' under 'TAGS'](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/264171) (SE blogs only)
* [mse268584: When a user is deleted, OP highlighting is lost](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/268584)
* [mso310158: Right to left marker in comment shouldn't cause the rest of the line to change](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/310158)

**Removed fixes:**

* [mso308513: Styling issue on upvoted comments by diamond moderators](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/308513) (CSS)

**Other changes:**

* Don't even try to run late setup and normal script fixes unless jQuery is available; it won't work.  Early (and mathjax) script fixes still run.
* Extended [codegolf959](https://codegolf.meta.stackexchange.com/q/959) fix (reduce line height in code blocks) also to puzzling.SE.
* [mse22372](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/22372): Don't rewrite links to per-site metas (meta.*.stackexchange.com) to use HTTPS; they [currently return a 403 Forbidden error.](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/265918)


1.40 (25 Oct 2015)
====

Just a bunch of new fixes, nothing too special this time.  The [mso308513](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/308513) issue has already been marked "status-completed" by SE, but it hasn't been deployed quite yet and having the style twice should do no harm, so I'm leaving it in for this release.

**New fixes in 1.40.0:**

* [rpg5812: Post as a guest: CSS bug](https://rpg.meta.stackexchange.com/q/5812) (CSS)
* [mso308513: Styling issue on upvoted comments by diamond moderators](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/308513) (CSS)
* [mse139175: When starring a message from the star board, it's not reflected in the main chat window](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/139175) (chat)
* [mse153528: Don't ask for a comment when downvoting, if the user just voted on a comment](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/153528)
* [mse259325: Answer flashes orange when I click the “edit (1)” link to review a suggested edit](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/259325)
* [mso306552: Votes cast has upvote-like symbol and is confusing](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/306552) (credit: AgeDeO and misterManSam)
* [mso308672: Alerts no longer work in StackOverflow snippets in Chrome 46+](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/308672)

**Removed fixes:**

* [mso283939: Flag for diamond moderator textarea breaks out of the dialog](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/283939)

**Other changes:**

* SOUP no longer injects its code into `<iframe>`s.  While there have been no reported bugs caused by this, it's still useless and unintentional behavior.


1.38 (3 Oct 2015)
====

This release contains a couple of fixes to the image upload dialog (mse266523, mse264307 and mse266779), a few CSS fixes and one rather interesting accessibility fix ([mse265889](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/265889)) which should actually be invisible to everyone, but audible to people using a screen reader.  There's also a bunch of changes to the "SOUP framework" that should make certain kinds of fixes faster, more reliable and easier to implement.

**New fixes in 1.38.0:**

* [mse265889: Improve answer navigation for screen readers](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/265889)
* [mse266258: Left side markdown diff outside of its area](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/266258) (CSS)
* [mse266523: Uploading an image from the web can leave paste broken in editor](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/266523)
* [mse264307: Down arrow key won't work after using the Hyperlink button](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/264307)
* [mse170970: Occasionally, the Unicode character sequence U+200C U+200B (ZWNJ ZWSP) is inserted into comments](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/170970)
* [mso306325: The yellow star in the sprites.svg image looks “unfinished”](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/306325) (CSS, SO only)
* [mse266747: Amazing! All sites have blogs!](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/266747) (CSS)
* [mse266779: Upload image not working after providing wrong URL](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/266779)

**Other changes:**

* Content filters are now (hopefully) applied correctly to edited posts reloaded via Ajax.
* Content filters applied to new / updated posts no longer need to reprocess all posts on the page.
* The content filter Ajax hook regexp is no longer exposed as `SOUP.contentFilterRegexp` (because we now use several hooks with different regexps).
* Ajax hooks can now receive the result of their regexp match as a fourth parameter.
* New `SOUP.subscribeToQuestion()` helper method for subscribing to realtime events (votes, accepts, etc.) on question pages.
* The [mse115702](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/115702) fix (enable delete link when downvoting an answer to -1) now uses the realtime event feed.
* The `SOUP.forEachTextNode()` method now passes the text content of each node as a parameter to the callback, and assigns any returned value back to the node.  The implementation should also be more efficient now, using native DOM traversal instead of recursive jQuery calls.

**Changes in 1.38.1:**

This point release fixes a bug that caused content filters not to run in the Markdown editor preview pane.

**Changes in 1.38.2:**

Removed the following fixes, as they're no longer needed:

* [mso302336: Don't fail LQP review audits just for looking at the deletion popup](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/302336)
* [mse266747: Amazing! All sites have blogs!](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/266747)
* [mse266779: Upload image not working after providing wrong URL](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/266779)
* [mso297171: Comment warning appears on next comment](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/297171)
* [mso283939: Flag for diamond moderator textarea breaks out of the dialog](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/283939)


1.36 (13 Sep 2015)
====

Another incremental release featuring two new fixes (and the expansion of one older fix to all sites).

**New fixes in 1.36.0:**

* [mso300679: Please block posts containing unsupported HTML](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/300679)
* [mse266034: Link the title of the linked questions sidebar to the list of linked questions](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/266034)

**Other changes:**

* The [graphicdesign2415](https://graphicdesign.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2415) CSS fix (for links in post warnings) is now applied globally.
* Some notable fixes are now **highlighted** in the README.

1.34 (31 Aug 2015)
====

Just a couple of new fixes in this release.  I'm trying to return to a somewhat faster and more regular schedule for stable releases, hence this second release this month.  The reorganization planned for 2.0 is currently on the back burner.

**New fixes in 1.34.0:**

* [mso302336: Don't fail LQP review audits just for looking at the deletion popup](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/302336)

* [rpg3554: Skin does not handle read-only mode well](https://rpg.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3554) (CSS, RPG.SE only)
* [mse240787: Inconsistent reputation mouse-over text](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/240787)

**Other changes:**

* Run content filters on expanded user cards (needed for [mse240787](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/240787)), add new `usercard` content filter type.

1.32 (13 Aug 2015)
====

This is mainly a cleanup release, removing several obsolete fixes for design bugs that have been quietly fixed by SE.  That said, a few new fixes are also included.

* [mse261721: Un-fade low-score answers on click/tap too](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/261721) (replaces [mse129593](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/129593))

**Removed CSS fixes:**

* [mse138685: Layout fix for Firefox in “Zoom text only” mode](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/138685)

1.30 (22 Jun 2015)
====

This is another late I-forgot-to-release-this-earlier version. :(  I've been quite busy since spring and haven't had much time to work on SOUP much, and the big SE redesign earlier this year made too many things into moving targets.  Anyway, all these fixes have been in the devel branch for several months, so at least they should be thoroughly tested. :)

My future plans involve doing another big testing session to see which old fixes can be safely removed, now that the new design has mostly stabilized, in preparation for SOUP v2.0.  (This is somewhat complicated by the fact that some of the issue have only been fixed partially.)  The 2.0 version, planned for sometime in August or September, will feature a more modular design, with the actual user script being built from many individual scriptlet files.  This should hopefully simplify editing and contributing new fixes, and also allow e.g. compiling SOUP into a stand-alone Chrome / Firefox extension.

**New fixes in 1.30.0:**

* [mse249859: &lt;kbd&gt; tags in headings are too small](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/249859) (CSS)
* [mse248156: What's the purpose of the tagline in the Bounties section of the profile?](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/248156) (CSS)

* [mso284223: Newly upvoted cool comments get an uncolored score](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/284223)
* [mso283939: Flag for diamond moderator textarea breaks out of the dialog](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/283939) (CSS)

* [graphicdesign2415: Design Bug: Tag alert CSS](https://graphicdesign.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2415) (CSS, graphicdesign.SE only)
* [math19650: Post with many lines of display math takes up most of the Questions page](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/q/19650) (math)
* [math19587: When editing tags, the bottom of the tag popup is invisible](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/q/19587) (CSS)
* [mso287222: Clicking between lines fails](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/287222) (CSS)

**Other changes:**

* Improved the [mse154788](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/154788) fix by adding `word-wrap: break-word` to comment styles; this should avoid the need for scroll bars in many cases.

1.28 (3 Feb 2015)
====

This version mainly features some older styling fixes that didn't make it into 1.26, released in preparation for a bunch of new fixes involving the Stack Overflow redesign.

**New fixes in 1.28.0:**

* [mse121682: Links to election nominations don't work after nominations close](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/121682)

1.26 (10 Dec 2014)
====

It's been a while since the last stable release, again.  I'd been meaning to carry out more systematic browser compatibility and regression testing before the next release, and to find and prune away fixes that may have become unnecessary, but I never got around to finishing that.  However, I've been using the devel version myself on both Firefox and Chrome long enough that I can probably consider it pretty well tested by now.  Opera compatibility is currently untested; if you're using SOUP on Opera and find any issues with it, please let me know!

Most of the changes in this version are back-end tweaks meant to improve performance and stability.  I've also partially rewritten the README page, and started documenting the SOUP internal structure and API at the [SOUP wiki on GitHub](https://github.com/vyznev/soup/wiki) to make third-party contributions easier.  Any feedback is welcome!

**New fixes in 1.26.0:**

* [salesforce836: Div containing 2 minute tour button not big enough](https://salesforce.meta.stackexchange.com/q/836) (CSS, salesforce.SE only)

* [mse240102: Lightbox sometimes doesn't go away when popup is closed in user profile editor](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/240102)
* [mse240710: Was the fringe always there on the up-rep icon?](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/240710) (CSS)
* [mse243519: Dangling signature dash in comments](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/243519)
* [mse84296: RTL text can mess up comment timestamps](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/84296) (CSS)

**Removed fixes:**

* [mse240486: Snippets editor won't insert and close on SO](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/240486)
* [mse240485: “Show more comments” link breaks for unregistered users if a comment is posted after page load](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/240485)

**Other changes:**

* Content filters are now applied to new comments loaded via Ajax.
* Made the content filter mechanism more flexible, so that filters can be made to run only on specific events.
* Made Ajax hooks run immediately by default to minimize flicker; let's see if this breaks anything...
* Content filters are now applied to answers loaded in review by the [mse172931](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/172931) fix.
* New utility function `SOUP.hookChat()` for monitoring chat events.
* Chat content filters now use the page visibility API to only run in active tabs.
* Removed unused `SOUP.requestAnimationFrame()` compatibility wrapper.
* The fix list in README.md is now grouped into sections, just like in the source.
* The license section now contains an explicit "do whatever you want" license grant to SE, Inc. in addition to the general ISC license.
* Various other README.md changes, including a direct install link for the devel branch and a link to the SOUP wiki on GitHub.

**New fixes in 1.26.1:**

This is a quick single-fix releast for the math.SE moderator election.

* [mse220611: Blue background on nominee comments only when expanded](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/220611)

**Changes in 1.26.2:**

* Fixed a silly SOUP bug causing JS fixes to run before DOM was fully loaded on some browsers.

**Changes in 1.26.3:**

* The [mse217779](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/217779) spoiler fix no longer breaks clicking the spoiler to toggle visibility.

1.24 (7 Oct 2014)
====

A relatively fast-track release for [mse240485](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/240485) and [mse240486](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/240486), which both involve loss of UI functionality.  Also includes a couple of new lower priority fixes, and one internal fix to a SOUP-induced UI regression on Chrome.

**Changes in 1.24.2:**

* Added `max-width: 100%` to the `<kbd>` tag style ([mse58760](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/58760)), just in case someone does something silly like [sticking a huge image inside `<kbd>` tags](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/273103).

**Changes in 1.24.1:**

* Removed the [mse240553](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/240553) fix added in 1.24.0, as it's no longer needed.

* [mse239549: Mobile user profile page sort selectors stop working after first change](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/239549)

* [mse240485: “Show more comments” link breaks for unregistered users if a comment is posted after page load](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/240485)

**Removed fixes:**

* [mse233470: Answer lock notice runs into text below](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/233470) (CSS, fixed)

**Other changes:**

* Redesignated the [stats1987](https://stats.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1987) fix as [mse154788](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/154788), since that post has a more comprehensive description of the issue.  Tweaked the CSS to avoid [occasional spurious scroll bars in Chrome](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/240352).

1.22 (15 Sep 2014)
====

This is just an incremental release to push out a few updates that missed v1.20 and were stuck in the devel branch.  More active development may or may not resume later in the year.  As always, contributions are welcome.

**New fixes in 1.22.0:**

* [math16552: Using \[tag:\] markup in posts creates an ugly gap between lines](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/q/16552) (CSS, math.SE only)

**Other changes:**

* Improved and simplified the [stats1987](https://stats.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1987) fix by using `max-width` instead of `table-layout: fixed`.  This fixes [a minor layout issue with large vote counts](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/229830) and adds scroll bars to over-wide comments.
* Added release dates to change log.  Trying out short release notes as well.
* Added `@homepageURL`, `@copyright` and `@license` metadata lines.

1.20 (28 Jul 2014)
====

**New fixes in 1.20.0:**

* [mse169225: Why does the bounty award button appear on deleted answers?](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/169225) (CSS)
* [mse266852: Bar between “add a comment” and “show more comments” is inconsistent](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/266852)

**Removed fixes:**

* [mse104184: Allow flagging a comment after upvoting it](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/104184) (fixed by SE)

**Other changes:**

* SOUP now hooks the WebSocket interface to detect chat events instead of polling for them.
* [mse229363](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/229363): Hot question titles from the [Aviation](https://aviation.stackexchange.com) and [Puzzling](https://puzzling.stackexchange.com) sites are now eligible for MathJax parsing.

1.18 (5 Jul 2014)
====

**New fixes in 1.18.0:**

* [mse234680: Domain names in an URL are incorrectly encoded as escaped ASCII characters instead of punycode](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/234680)

**Other changes:**

* The sidebar question score wrap fix ([mse229751](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/229751)) is split into a global part and a site-specific part.

* The HTTPS link rewrite fix ([mse221304](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/221304)) is now applied also to chat and area51 links.
* Content filters now work properly on chat (using brute-force 0.5s interval polling, since there's no proper hook for chat updates).
* `SOUP.isChat()` and `SOUP.isMeta()` are now set already during early setup.
* Devel branch versions should now auto-update properly (and not just when a new master release is made).
* Update checking is optimized by duplicating the script metadata in `SOUP.meta.js` and pointing `@updateURL` to it instead of the main script.

1.16 (26 Jun 2014)
====

**Changes in 1.16.1:**

* The [mse229759](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/229759) fix has been made redundant, only a few hours after v1.16.0 was released.

* [mse229797: You are here, but where's here?](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/229797) (CSS, meta.SE only)
* [french347: Make spaces unbreakable when it's obvious that a line-break should not occur](https://french.meta.stackexchange.com/q/347) (french.SE only)

**Other changes:**

* The [mse230607](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/230607) fix is no longer needed, and has been removed.
* The [mse224628](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/224628) fix is no longer relevant, since the 10k flag review page no longer exists; the code has been adapted for [mse115702](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/115702) instead.
* [mse229363](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/229363): MathJax is now also parsed in hot question titles from earthscience.SE.
* The [math12803](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/q/12803) fix is now split into two parts, of which one is math.SE specific and the other is applied on all sites.
* The [mse215473](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/215473) styles are no longer incorrectly applied to links in popups created from the post menu.
* Fixes can now run scripts early, before the document loads, by specifying them with the `early` property.  Note that jQuery is typically not yet available at that stage.
* New `SOUP.addContentFilter()` utility method to simplify fixes that manipulate post content.
* Fancy new icon.

1.14 (11 May 2014)
====
